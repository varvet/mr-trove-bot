Varvet has been asked to design the user experience of the \napplication — ensuring that the product reflects the brand’s values \nthrough every interaction.\n\nAs a first step, Varvet will define the app’s core UX concepts and develop \nwireframe sketches that outline key views, features, and flows. \n\nBy developing UX and brand in tandem, the process ensures clarity, \nconsistency, and coherence from day one."

It means fulfilling the \nbrand promise through every user \ninteraction, ensuring that functionality, \nuser experience, and interface align with \nthe brand’s personality.\n\n\nAlongside brand development, Varvet will \nwork closely with BAS ID to define the user \nexperience. Varvet will translate the brand \nconcept into UX strategies, user flows, and \nwireframes, then turn these into interface \ndesigns and interactive prototypes.\n\nThis approach ensures strong alignment \nbetween the brand and product, resulting in \na cohesive and motivating investment \nexperience aimed at long-term growth."
